This theme supports custom taxonomy and growth stage indicators.
By default `seedling`, `budding` and `evergreen` will have predefined indicator.

But fist, it must be manually set up as follows:

1. Register the taxonomy in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[taxonomies]
    stage = "stage"
```

2. Create taxonomy folder and it's terms `_index.md`:

```
mysite/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ content/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stage/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€ seedling/
    â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€ _index.md
    â”‚       â”œâ”€ budding/
    â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€ _index.md
    â”‚       â””â”€ evergreen/
    â”‚           â””â”€ _index.md
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

3. Within  `_index.md`, Set the stage `title` and `translationKey` if site is multilingual,
 you can also override custom `indicator` or `emoji`:

```yaml
---
title: 'Stage of me being Godzilla'
translationKey: godzilla
emoji: 'ðŸ¦–'
# indicator: 'https://example.com/indicator.svg'
---

You can write the introduction or blah blah blah here
```

4. Add the stage parameter into your post `index.md`:

```yaml
---
title: 'My Post'
stage: 'seedling'
---
```
